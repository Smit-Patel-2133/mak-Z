## 6. TESTING

### 6.1 Unit Testing

In our project, we've embraced unit testing as a core practice in software development. By rigorously testing individual components or functions in isolation, we ensure they perform as expected. Automated unit tests run frequently, catching bugs early and enabling swift fixes. This approach not only enhances code quality but also fosters project stability and facilitates smooth refactoring. Overall, unit testing is integral to our software testing lifecycle, helping us deliver reliable software to users.
